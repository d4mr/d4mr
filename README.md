## highlights

- [**ETHIndia 2024 Winner**](https://x.com/ETHIndiaco/status/1866098806758252987) — 1st place with zkRail. ZK proofs meet game theory meet fiat rails.
- [**ERC-7518**](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7518) co-author — an actual Ethereum standard I helped write. for compliant RWA tokenization.
- [**Zypherpunk 2025**](zypherpunk.d4mr.com/project/tz-2bf2) - 1st place Electric Coin Company track, Network State + Raybot + Tachyon bounties
- **Built the first ERC-4337 multichain wallet** — weekend hackathon POC at Biconomy that became a thing.
- [**engine-core**](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/engine-core) — production Rust web3 backend of your dream. the best thing I've ever built.

## things I've built

### [zkRail](https://github.com/d4mr/zkrail) — ETHIndia 2024 Winner
Smart contracts executing real-world payments without bank accounts. Zero-knowledge proofs meet game theory. Won Coinbase, CDP, and Polygon tracks because apparently the judges were as hyped as I was.

### [engine-core](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/engine-core)
2.5 years of learnings distilled into 25k lines of Rust. Sophisticated nonce management, crash recovery, exactly-once delivery. All that coordination complexity that used to keep me up at 3am debugging nonce sync hell? Gone. The flow became poetry: recover, confirm, send, yield.

inside engine-core also lies BullMQ-lite. We built twmq because nothing had the queue semantics we needed.

### [t2z](https://github.com/d4mr/t2z)
Transparent to shielded Zcash transactions. Unified Rust core, WASM for web. Privacy is cool.

### [bother](https://github.com/d4mr/bother)
Batch image processing entirely client-side. No uploads, no registration, no ads, no bullshit. Just works.

### [riveter](https://github.com/d4mr/riveter)
Rust CLI to dump directory structure and file contents for LLM context. Built it because I needed it.

### [adcast](https://github.com/d4mr/adcast)
Golang CLI for dynamically embedding targeted ads into podcast media files.

## where I've been

**thirdweb** — Software Engineer (2024-2025)
Built Engine and Vault. Production transaction infrastructure and non-custodial key management secured with AWS Nitro Enclaves. Got to "rewrite it in Rust" and actually ship it.

**Zoniqx** — Lead Architect (2022-2024)
Co-authored ERC-7518. Built first compliant RWA tokenization layer on XRPL. Led major rewrites because sometimes you just have to burn it down and start fresh.

**Biconomy** — Software Engineer (2021-2022)
Helped gasless infrastructure revamp processing millions of transactions for clients like JP Morgan. Built the first multichain ERC-4337 wallet as a weekend hackathon POC.

**Libertas Network** — Senior Fullstack Developer (2021)
First full-time role building blockchain-based censorship-resistant podcasting infrastructure.

## writing

I write about weird edge cases, 3am debugging sessions, and "wait why does this have two valid hashes" rabbit holes.
